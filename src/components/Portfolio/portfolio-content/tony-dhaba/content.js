  "Tony Dhaba is a full-fledged restaurant website I built for a local eatery in my town. The goal was to digitize the dining experience while keeping the dhaba vibes alive.",
  "I designed an interactive UI using Tailwind and animations with Framer Motion. It includes features like live menu updates, table reservation system, and integration with Google Maps for easy navigation.",
  "The backend was powered by Firebase for fast and scalable hosting, and Firestore for storing reservations securely. This project helped the restaurant increase footfall by 30% in its first month.",
